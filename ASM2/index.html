      <p class="w3-justify w3-col m7 w3-right w3-padding ">My name is Tran Thi Thuy Tien, and my student ID is 3825458. Presently, I am majoring in Human Resources Management (HRM) at RMIT university. I am an extrovert that really enjoys making new friends, therefore, I joined many clubs, such as RMIT Human Development Club which enables me to develop interpersonal skills and meet friends who share mutual interests. My enjoyment for IT started when I attended an online event that focused on how IT will affect HRM in the future. That’s when I realized the importance of technical skill and data analysis if I want to succeed with my future career path. Moreover, our team’s name is related to two of my interests right now: business and IT - with a desire to create and support other businesses with IT solutions in the future.

Therefore, RMIT is my destination as its Digital Marketing degree integrates both academic and hands-on practice excellently. Another reason I study Digital Marketing is because I always have a soft spot for technology, which explains why I chose a major which combines both marketing and technology. I consider myself as a creative yet logical person as well as a quick and diligent learner who is not afraid to embrace changes. Besides studying, I also applied for several jobs to nurture skills and knowledge. One of my proudest jobs is working as an intern for a famous Digital & Creative Marketing agency, in which I had the opportunity to collaborate with co-workers to use digital platforms and technology to support marketing strategies such as design, develop and code website, produce and render video, etc. The 6-month internship has fueled my motivation to explore more about the IT world, as I acknowledge marketing without technology will fail to impress the consumers and influence their buying behaviour. By enrolling in this course, I hope to broaden my knowledge about IT knowledge and its application in our daily lives.</p>

Currently, I am a final year student in RMIT with a major in Logistics & Supply chain management. I define myself as an outgoing and energetic person; besides, I am an progesstive person This could be illustrated clearly through my participation in two student clubs which are AIESEC and RMIT Business Club when I am a first-year student. Talking about my IT preference, I am super interested in neural networks and artificial intelligence (AI) in the IT industry. This interest originated from a “Business IT” course in RMIT in which I was given an assignment to research deeply about the application of demand planning in a furniture enterprise. Therefore, that assignment actually triggered my interest in how demand forecasting and demand sensing are applied in many industries in daily life. Since I still do not have any IT experience, I am trying my best to absorb more IT knowledge through the provision of IT-related courses on LinkedIn library or Cousera before having a chance to step into the IT working industry.

Currently, I am a junior at RMIT with a bachelor's School in Business and Management. I enrolled at the end of 2019 since the environment at RMIT is international. My sID  is s3818514. With that ID, every student can access every facility in RMIT. Since the second semester of 2021 ended, I started exploring and designing my career path during semester break. During the first week of semester break, I intentionally watched the video of Tinh Te’s workshop discussing the Data Analytics career path. Although I have not approached Information Technology before, I find it interesting, especially the Data aspect. Therefore, I am preparing to become a Business Analyst.

With good critical-thinking ability and a high sense of commitment, I believe I can give the ideal solutions to many problems, and ensure everyone’s work will meet the highest standard. Besides, I am also a good listener thanks to the Learning test result. Thus, I could utilize this ability to foster the bonding and harmony among team members, avoiding unnecessary conflicts by listening respectfully to their ideas, making them feel heard and respected. With these aforementioned strengths and the collaboration with teammates who have different personalities like Nguyen, I hope to bring out the dynamism, equal contribution and respect to achieve the ultimate goal.

        <p class=" w3-justify">Overall, these tests somehow express how I communicate and work with others in this stage of my life. I believe these tests will not influence my behavior on a team. I'm an Introvert and Extrovert person. It implies that between working with a team as in surface, I also spend time reflecting on my work, which I believe will help a lot in the group. Otherwise, I'm a Tactile learner who's willing to dive into the project more than just discussing a subject. Especially in IT, consulting and ready theory to find a solution are just not enough. Digging while doing something is the best way to find the error and directly fix it. Therefore, it could be a positive trait for me to work in a team. Finally, the openness score shows me as a person that thinks in a sophisticated and complex idea. However, I think it could be a good point in teamwork. With a broad way of thinking, I can gather all of the necessary information for the work.

Lastly, at the present, Blockchain 3.0 is described as publicly disseminated and widely distributed in the society (Lee 2019).Currently, blockchain can impact numerous industries to make it more effient and transparent. For financial companies, blockchain enables digital asset exchange (such as Bitcoin or Ethereum), detect fraud in trading, facilitate investment and money transfer, etc (Daley 2021). Regarding the healthcare sector, big data in blockchain allows doctors to secure sensitive information of patients and even share or display healthcare plans individually (Daley 2021). In the real-estate industry, real-time contracts are enabled in blockchain to ensure all the parties accountability and compliances. With IoT companies, blockchain is facilitated through software and microchip hardware to produce a product that  encrypts ledger data (IBM n.d.).</h6><br>
        <h3 ><i>The newest technology of Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies / The future of Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies in the next three years / The technology or development that support the future of Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies:</h6><br>
        <h6 class="w3-justify">According to a survey conducted by Deloitte in 2021, Blockchain and cryptocurrencies in the next three to ten years will revolutionize digital assets while replacing fiat money (Deloitte 2021). Specifically, financial services industries (FSI) are gradually employing blockchain solutions into their core business operations to create competitive advantages and increase scalability: application of blockchain technology to deposits, payments and funding is believed to be safe - it will create a new revenue stream for banks and the FSI. Moreover, the adoption of blockchain technology to voting is promising by using a specified blockchain code, voter can vote through their phones or computers instead of going to a venue and write their vote - an instantly verifiable result will appears, avoiding fraud or interference but  also can protect voter information (PWC n.d.). Besides, AI and blockchain technology could create the intelligent transport system (ITS) assisted data analysis and transmission among vehicles to reduce cost for supply chain management industry (Yuan & Wang 2016).</h6><br>
        <h6 class="w3-justify">Regarding cryptocurrencies, there are still many countries that consider crypto-related transactions as illegal. Therefore, in the future, it is expected that there will be a cryptocurrencies regulation and detailed guidelines to ensure safety for traders and investors (Haar 2021). Furthermore, with increasing interest in cryptocurrencies, experts predicted that it will be adopted broadly by many institutions, changing the digital landscape in the future (Haar 2021). For instance, financial technology companies like PayPal or automotive car companies like Tesla are allowing their users to pay for their products by Bitcoin (Newbery 2021). It is forecasted that other technological companies will gradually adopt this method of payment to everyday use and with increasing demand, cryptocurrencies are likely to advance its value.</h6><br>
        <h3 ><i>The possible impact of future Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies / The changes that are likely to be made by Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies / The type of people that can be affected by Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies:</i></h3><br>
        <h6 class="w3-justify">Accounting is the field that is likely to be impacted most by blockchain audit technology. As mentioned before, blockchain have the ability to fully keep track of the recordkeeping process: each of the transactions can be monitored from the first stage to processed, recorded and reported by blockchain technology. It is preferable that we should identify greater transparency regarding auditing financial statements - to efficiently extract data and analysis. With blockchain audit technology, auditor professionals are given a chance to access real-time data via nodes of blockchain - enabling them to have a structured and consistent format of information (Deloitte 2017).</h6><br>
        <h6 class="w3-justify">Therefore, the business processes and business models in the future are likely to be revolutionized, moreover, job descriptions and skill sets of Certified Public Accountants (CPA) might be redefined as the emergence of the blockchain ecosystem. According to Deloitte (2017), there are several possible future roles for CPA - replacing the traditional roles - to be adaptable with the blockchain ecosystem: CPA will need to study and comprehend the technical programming language, or understand the mechanism of blockchain to become the auditor of smart contracts that is embedded in blockchain system. Hence, CPA professionals need to embrace this advanced technology, and are encouraged to be aware of the skills and qualifications that are needed in order to meet the market demand, otherwise, they would be replaced and become redundant in the fast-paced world of technological advancement.</h6><br>
        <h3 ><i>Effect of Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies on me / Effect of Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies on my family and friends:</i></h3><br>
        <h6 class="w3-justify">It is noteworthy that the blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies are transforming and revolutionizing our world at a fast-paced pace. Although the concept of paying Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies instead of cash is still unfamiliar to some people, I still believe that blockchain technology will make that easier and more convenient to our lives. In the future, I think me and my friends - who are genuine tech savvy - will buy cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin to use for everyday transactions instead of cash or credit cards. This is because blockchain has strict privacy protection and a protocol to help me with easier money transactions or exchange, so that me and my family do not need to go to the bank or register for a credit card to authenticate myself. Moreover, the blockchain-based social platforms priorities users control has made me feel very comfortable since it enables end-to-end encryption that would carefully protect my personal identities. In stark contrast, the current popular social media platforms are known for manipulating its user information for higher profit. Therefore, in the future, I think I would convince my family members to switch to decentralized social platforms - to secure personal data.</h6><br>
        <h6 class="w3-justify">Furthermore, according to recent studies of Guardian Seascape, 36% of fish were mislabelled and lack transparency (Leahy 2021). However, IBM has collaborated with many food companies to address this issue: they would integrate blockchain technology to supply chain management (SCM) industry - to provide clear information for the products and avoid mislabelled (Terra Pass 2021). Therefore, in the future, me and my family would find it easier to keep track of the product that we are using, for instance, which pesticide is used for our vegetables, or the origin of the vegetable and also can make cryptocurrencies payment for the farmers directly through decentralized system.</h6>

        <h3 ><i>What does Artificial Intelligence do?</i></h3><br>
        <h6 class="w3-justify">Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a computer system that performs human activities based on the nine ordinary human bits of intelligence: problem-solving, perception, natural language communication, motion and manipulation, learning, representing knowledge, planning, social awareness and skills, and general intelligence (Rahman 2020). However, general AI can apply to a wide variety of activities. Therefore, many researchers have broken AI down into pieces to understand AI properly. They have come up with narrow AI building blocks that are used today and in the future, no matter how sophisticated the system is since it is focused on performing a specific task. Below are 4 characteristics of narrow AI and its applications. As a consequence, AI has two types: Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI), known as Weak AI, and Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), known as Strong AI.</h6><br>
        <h6 class="w3-justify">Machine Learning plays as a subset of AI. It is defined that it has the ability to gain new knowledge by generalizing examples and experience and performing its activities without programming (Kim 2020). As it is said that machine learning has the ability to gain new experience, how do computers learn new things? According to Rapidapi (2020), computers learn new things when they analyze data. For instance, in the marketing sector, computers analyze the shopping pattern of customers and based on that information, they can provide predictions for the development trend of the business.</h6><br>

        <h3 ><i>The newest technology of Artificial Intelligence / The future of Artificial Intelligence in the next three years / The technology or development that support the future of Artificial Intelligence:</i></h3><br>
        <h6 class="w3-justify">With the advantages of AI, it has been implemented in many different fields such as healthcare, education, and business (Burns, Laskowski & Tucci 2021). For the healthcare sector, in the case of COVID-19, AI and Machine Learning are used widely to predict the trend of the pandemic as well as recognise the symptoms of the patient. According to Hussain, Dawood and Al-Turjma (2021), the best way to fight against the coronavirus is quick treatment and accurate predictions about the sickness. However, some of the businesses are devoted to applying AI and Machine Learning in healthcare since it is expensive. Regarding the business sector, machine learning algorithms are being implemented into analytics and customer relationship management (CRM) platforms in order to obtain data on how to provide better service to clients. The innovation of this action is Chatbots, they have been integrated into websites to give customers immediate support (Cognillo 2019). Academics and IT analysts are debating whether or not employment positions should be automated.</h6><br>
        <h6 class="w3-justify">According to the Boston Retail Partners 2017 Customer Experience survey, it demonstrated that 45% of retailers are willing to use AI in their business (O'shea 2017). The capacity of AI to automate and learn from consumer interactions, as well as predict how those interactions will play out in many circumstances, makes it a very useful technology tool for businesses. Furthermore, Rowan (2020) stated that AI is just in the state of implementation. There is more room for AI to nourish in the next 3 years. Particularly in the field of deep learning since it rapidly applies to almost all businesses. Consequently, in the world of AI, many researchers are heading to AGI which is a benchmark for them to achieve in the world of AI, therefore there is no doubt that AI would develop in the next 3 years.</h6><br>
        <h3><i>The possible impact of future Artificial Intelligence / The changes that are likely to be made by Artificial Intelligence / The type of people that can be affected by Artificial Intelligence:</i></h3><br>
        <h6 class="w3-justify">As mentioned above, AI would benefit different sectors from healthcare, business to security. However, regarding the impact of AI, it is always divided into two sides. Therefore, whoever benefits from AI also takes the risk of being harmed by AI.</h6><br>
        <h6 class="w3-justify">The positive impacts (Tai 2020):</h6><br>
        <h6 class="w3-justify">- AI can have a significant impact on healthcare through improving monitoring and diagnostic skills. AI can cut operating expenses and save money by improving the operations of healthcare institutions and medical organizations</h6><br>
        <h6 class="w3-justify">- AI has the potential to significantly increase the efficiency of our workplaces while also augmenting the job that humans can accomplish. When AI takes over mundane or dangerous duties, it frees up the human labor to focus on tasks that require creativity and empathy, among other things.</h6><br>
        <h6 class="w3-justify">The negative impacts (Bernard Marr 2021):</h6><br>
        <h6 class="w3-justify">- Many employment will be created by AI, and many people expect a net gain in jobs or at least the same amount of jobs to be created to replace those that are lost as a result of AI technology. There will be tasks that people do now that computers will take over. This will necessitate modifications to training and education programs in order to prepare our future workforce, as well as assisting present employees in transitioning to new jobs that will utilize their unique human skills.</h6><br>
        <h6 class="w3-justify">- AI algorithms are created by humans, therefore those who either purposefully or mistakenly add bias into the algorithm can bring bias into the algorithm. AI algorithms will yield biased results if they are created with a bias or if the data in the training sets they are given to learn from is biased. This reality could have unexpected repercussions, similar to what we've seen with discriminating hiring algorithms and Microsoft's racist Twitter chatbot. Companies must design and train AI systems responsibly as they build them.</h6><br>
        <h6 class="w3-justify">As a result, although AI has the potential to improve medical diagnosis or employment, human experts are still required to avoid overusing it because AI is not optimal enough to solve all human problems.</h6><br>

      <h1 class="w3-opacity w3-left"><i>CLOUD COMPUTING</i></h1>
    </div>
    <div class="w3-container w3-content w3-padding-10 w3-opacity" style="max-width:900px">
        <h3 ><i>What do cloud, services, and servers do?</i></h3><br>
        <h6 class="w3-justify">Cloud computing is defined as an outstanding and superior solution in offering an on-demand, adjustable and scalable information technology infrastructure for various applications (Furht & Escalante 2010). In other words, this is a computing environment where computing resources such as emails and even databases could be easily accessed by users via the internet. Plus, this concept also refers to an intersection of two main trends in IT called IT efficiency and organisational agility. Specifically, the first trend is about the power of computers applied more intelligently and flexibly via both software and hardware resources whereas business agility is defined as the perfect combination of intensive business computing analytics and mobile inter-active applications which leads to the real-time response to end users’ demand (Avram 2914). In terms of cloud computing architecture, cloud computing would be classified as front-end and back-end in which front-end is about what users would see whilst back-end refers to the cloud computing services (i.e. storage) (Modi & Jadeja 2014). Besides, there would exist 5 layers which aim to satisfy different purposes of customers.</h6><br>
        <h6 class="w3-justify">Therefore, with all of these aforementioned characteristics of cloud computing, it would help users to take advantage of distributed resources as well as combine them to attain more efficient outputs in order to tackle the issues related to large scale computation. In brief, some common challenges such as scalability, service quality, privacy could be easily solved with the support of cloud computing (Modi & Jadeja 2014).</h6><br>
       <h3 ><i>The newest technology of Cloud Computing / The future of Cloud Computing in the next three years / The technology or development that support the future of Cloud Computing:</i></h3><br>
       <h6 class="w3-justify">Some state-of-the-art implementations of cloud computing which indicate some key technologies used for cloud computing would be presented in a deeper perspective. The first one would be the architecture design of data centers. A data center, which comprises computational and storage resources, would be at the foundation of cloud computing and thousands of devices such as servers and routers. The planning stage of this architecture should be planned accurately due to its strong impact on application performance in this distributed environment (Zhang, Cheng & Boutaba 2010). The second technology would be about cloud-based distributed file systems which mainly refers to Google File System (GFS). Indeed, compared to other traditional-file-systems, it is mapped out to optimize data centers, which aims to offer high flexibility, low latency and have the ability to exist after server failures. The final critical element would refer to the distributed application framework; in fact, the existence of software framework (i.e. MapReduce) would facilitate distributed computing on computers’ clusters for huge datasets. As a result, all of the aforementioned attributes are major contributors to the state-of-the art of cloud computing.</h6><br>
       <h6 class="w3-justify">It could be said that cloud computing has broad applications in many industries. Indeed, according to Thien Vo (2021), cloud computing is the most eminent element in the digital infrastructure which would boost both digital transformation and the country's economy. Based on the statistics, there exist more than 20 database centers and 300,000 servers managed by major companies in Vietnam (e.g. FBT, Viettel) which are totally not small figures (Tran 2020). Talking about major applications by industry/ target, there could include private enterprises, government, retailing, healthcare, institutions and other important sectors (Finance Yahoo 2021).</h6><br>
       <h6 class="w3-justify">From 2021, in the next three years, the world would observe the proliferation of clouds, services and even services after the extreme impact of COVID-19 pandemic. Indeed, as the effect of COVID-19 is predicted to continuously remain, enterprises would look to create a strong foundation for agility in order to minimize the impact. When the workplace would be more decentralized and employees work remotely, cloud computing would play a major contribution in ensuring flexibility, productivity and scalability and fix the issues related to geographical restrictions (Parma 2021). In other words, the pandemic has once again reinforced the value proposition of cloud computing as its capability in forming on-demand cloud models for companies to attain cost efficiency, responsiveness as well as speed up their digital transformation process (Nag 2021). The future below somehow illustrates the strong demand for cloud in the next year.</h6><br>
       <img src="Cloud computing image.JPG" class="" alt="User expenditure forecast on public cloud services (Adopted from: Parma 2021) " style="width:80%">
       <h6 class="w3-justify">Based on my research,  the multi-cloud development model which reflects the combination of more than two cloud computing services (e.g. Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services, Oracle Cloud) would help firms to minimize the uncertainty of cloud reliability and reduce minimal latency through allowing firms to locate computer resources in close proximity to end users (Earls 2021). Due to its outstanding performance, this model would be selected for future implementation. Besides, the cloud security topic (i.e. network security, data security, client server security) needs to be investigated more deeply by experts in the future since this is defined as one of the major concerns for end-users; some practices towards the password protection and user accessibility should be taken into account for the future development of Cloud Computing (Reddy 2019). Finally, after realizing the close-knit integration of Artificial Intelligence and cloud computing by many companies (the research showed that more than 80% of firms is combine both AI and cloud computing in their operational activities in 2020), the concept about cloud-based artificial intelligence should be investigated more comprehensively in the future (Ribeiro 2021).</h6><br>
       <h3 ><i>The possible impact of future Cloud Computing / The changes that are likely to be made by Cloud Computing / The type of people that can be affected by Cloud Computing:</i></h3><br>
        <h6 class="w3-justify">Cloud computing would strengthen the country's economy through the offering of new IT related jobs. Besides, since the smartphone service sector and the aviation industry would gradually apply cloud computing, new opportunities for the staffing of data centers to operate the cloud would also be increased. More emphasized, there is also an increasing demand in lifting the skills of the existing labour workforce. Further explaining, the upskilling would lead to higher income from employees and higher standard of living, which ultimately exerts a positive impact on GDP in the country (Diacon & Maha 2015).</h6><br>
        <h6 class="w3-justify">In response to the question "Who might be affected by cloud computing?", cloud computing would pave the way for small and medium businesses (SME) to leverage cloud technology and advance in their areas of specialization. Infant industries that had difficulty in obtaining start-up capital to invest in IT resources now could focus to develop in production and service delivery by deploying intensive R&D services (Controller 2019). Small businesses could derive benefits the most from cloud computing since they could seek revenue opportunities related to cloud infrastructure as well as procedures optimization. In brief, cloud computing has successfully transformed traditional computing, allowing higher outcomes with limited required resources.</h6><br>
        <h3 ><i>Effect of Cloud Computing on me / Effect of Cloud Computing on my family and friends: </i></h3><br>
        <h6 class="w3-justify">It could be affirmed that cloud storage applications, such as Google Drive, Onedrive, iCloud are of paramount importance in the learning and working life of many people nowadays. The first critical advantage is that the data can be shared easily; indeed, in the past, the information was written on paper and would be shared with other organisations or collaborators in Excel or PDF. However, with the support of cloud computing, there is no need to save the file manually and send it to the collaborators by, for example, email. Instead, it is possible to issue the link to share the data, so it’s totally time-saving for me as well. Secondly, the other merit of utilizing cloud computing would indicate the safe data storage. Provided that there is information stored on paper or even USB sticks and hard drives, there would be a high probability probably to be lost due to the massive amount of papers. Therefore, I could say that cloud computing has exerted a positive influence on my daily work and study due to the flexible information sharing and recovery of personal documents.</h6><br>
        <h6 class="w3-justify">In fact, cloud storage is witnessing a significant development in both educational and work environments. Specifically, educational institutions have started to apply technology in their teaching process including cloud computing and encourage students to use cloud platforms in submitting and storing assignments online. Besides, in the context of COVID-19, communication is no longer a challenging problem since cloud computing applications (i.e. skype, microsoft teams) allow us to communicate quickly and efficiently from any location. Indeed, as my parents have worked online from home due to the impact of COVID-19, thanks to the support of Microsoft Teams, they could collaborate on content in real time and near-real time across different devices such as laptops and mobile devices. Therefore, it could be said that cloud computing has supported my family in doing our work in the most efficient and productive way.</h6><br>

        <h3 ><i>What do robots do?</i></h3><br>
        <h6 class="w3-justify">A future where robots are wovening into the fabric of human life and become as common as smartphones are unavoidable. Nowadays, robots have enhanced the quality of human lives in all aspects by providing the support for both physical and cognitive tasks (Rus 2020). Throughout history, robots’ shapes have been changed constantly to adapt to human’s needs. Today robots are designed to have limbs so that they can walk and behave like a human being, and have API automation to perform specific tasks automatically (Wang & Tao 2018). These modern robotics are developed to be able to scan and analyse the environment where they are placed thanks to the camera, ultrasonic sensors and other built-in functions to help humans in different circumstances. For example, robots help people in the construction sites, enabling the investigation of unreachable environments, from deep oceans to outer space. There are so-called Wandercraft robots to provide the disabled patients the expertise with an exoskeleton to help them learn to walk again. Pepper - the world’s first humanoid robot manufactured by a French company to detect human’s emotion like sadness, anger, joy, surprise, etc. by assessing the tone of voice and facial expressions, its application is mainly used in customer service industry (Kumar 2021).</h6><br>
        <h3 ><i>The newest technology of Robots / The future of Robots in the next three years / The technology or development that support the future of Robots:</i></h3><br>
        <h6 class="w3-justify">Robotics - the programmed machines that help humans with simple to complex tasks, and even tasks that cannot or should not be performed by humans are showing up ubiquitously in many key areas of life. When COVID-19 hit, many hospitals started deploying robotics to perform a wide range of tasks and reduce exposure to pathogens. Specifically, there are robots to help clean, disinfect and prepare patient rooms to diminish person-to-person contact between healthcare workers and patients, especially in cases of infectious diseases. Also, there are robots programmed with AI-enabled medicine identifiers to help doctors save time by distributing prescriptions that match with patients’ diseases (Intel 2019).With the evolution of technology, robots are transforming how surgeries work. The Mako robots produced by Stryker are developed to perform orthopedic surgeries like knees and joint replacements, therefore, assisting surgeons to locate precise directions during surgery procedures (Central Indiana Orthopedics 2019). In the hospitality industry, many types of robots with different functions are utilized to save time and labour cost. For example, the Yobot robot assists visitors to carry their luggages during check-in and check-out. As these robots can handle around 300 luggages per day, they accelerate check-in time and make hotel workers focus on serving the guests rather than lifting heavy stuff that exhaust their health.</h6><br> 
        <h6 class="w3-justify">As the robotics industry keeps innovating thanks to the combination of AI, vision and other sensory technologies, this makes robots become more human-like in terms of both appearance and cognitive ability. In the medical field, scientists are developing a robot named Saul that can kill off diseases such as Ebola, Smallpox, HIV, Influenza, etc. To do this, Paul utilizes pulses with high intensity and high-energy ultraviolet rays to open bacteria cells and destroy the pathogens. The world has been facing the outbreak of COVID-19 for 2 years, urging more investments should be made to complete these ‘Paul’ robots to help the frontline workers deal with infectious diseases. In order to do this, the integration of communications, visuals, sensory technologies and a 254 nanometer UV light combined with ultraviolet radiant devices are needed (ASME 2019). Besides, autonomous robots are common in different areas of life thanks to their ability to work without human intervention. An example of a simple autonomous robot is a vacuum machine, which can identify obstacles and navigate accordingly to avoid hurting itself or people and property. Another complex usage of autonomous robots is in delivery to transport goods to customers without human assistance, thus saving effort, time and pollution caused by transporting vehicles. To maximize the use of this robots, sensor technologies including cameras, machine vision, ultrasonic sensors, radar and PSP integration are required to help robots detect objects, self-drive and navigate itself correctly (Marr 2021).</h6><br> 
        <h3 ><i>The possible impact of future Robots / The changes that are likely to be made by Robots / The type of people that can be affected by Robots:</i></h3><br>
        <h6 class="w3-justify">The invasion of robots has brought both positive and negative impacts on our life. Industries that have the highest robot adoption are automotive, electronics, chemical and plastics, with the employment rates being 38%, 15% and 10% respectively. The reasons for adoption are to save employees from unwanted casualties, producing more quality and accurate work, saving time and money, doing monotonous and repetitive tasks for humans (Thomas 2021). Along with those advantages, however, the major negative side of robots is that they are replacing humans, especially those without a college degree, thus leading to alert unemployment rates. Besides replacement effects, the deployment of robots by companies caused 120 million workers worldwide to need retraining so that they can perform at more challenging tasks in which robots cannot compete with human intelligence. Therefore, as negative as it sounds at first, this actually opens opportunities for employees to learn and update their skills constantly, so that they can control robots and turn them into their own assistants, instead of fearing that robots will steal their jobs. Having said that, experts are yearning for a future where robots and humans cooperate to create outstanding work and a quality workforce in which innate human skills cannot be replicated by machines (Weise 2018).</h6><br> 
        <h3 ><i>Effect of Robots on me / Effect of Robots on my family and friends:</i></h3><br>
        <h6 class="w3-justify">With the innovation of technology, robots have brought benefits and conveniences to our daily life. One of the most common automated devices that many modern households have nowadays are the cleaning robot. In my family, this robotic device has become a super useful assistant for all the family members in doing the household chores, which saves us lots of time and effort that can be spent on more important tasks. Being supported with AI and sensor technology, the vacuum’s settings are automatically adjusted to detect changes in the floor surfaces such as carpet, wood, glass, etc. as well as know which parts of the house has more dirt so that it will spend more time cleaning them. Most importantly, this kind of autonomous robot does not need human assistance or intervention to complete the task. Because the robotic vacuum can be programmed to clean at a specific time of a day, therefore, my family could be on a vacation for a week without worrying that our home will get dirty. Accordingly, compared to the previous time when the cleaning robot was not invented, my family and I have to spend many hours cleaning our 3-floor house and get exhausted afterwards. But thanks to the device, it is such a relief when it comes to cleaning.</h6><br>

    <h6 class="w3-justify">The idea of our project is the combination from two of our members: Tien and Chau. In the first assignment, Tien has proposed an application that could support people who can not afford gym fees with home workout plans and healthy meals to help them lose weight at home, instead of going to public places that could be dangerous in the COVID-19 pandemic scenario. Meanwhile, Chau has come up with a platform ‘Smart Health Prediction’ - which patients can input their health conditions so that AI can predict their current state of disease and receive appropriate guidance.</h6><br> 
    <h6 class="w3-justify">However, the field of health care has a lot of types of disease, and we are not the expertise in that field, so we decided to narrow down our scope to obesity. Particularly, our application will have two special features: the 3D image feature would be used to scan user’s body and predict which muscle group on their body will need to be improved, and the Artificial Intelligence feature will automatically calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI) - a weight-to-height ratio that can be used to indicate whether a person is overweight or underweight - based on the input of users about their current weight and height.</h6><br> 

    <h2 class="w3-opacity w3-left"><i><u>2. Motivation:</u></i></h2>
    </div>
    <h6 class="w3-justify">The determination of our team in building this project is that we care about people’s health. As we are still young and have many times to workout to improve health, instead of staying in bed or sitting at one place for too long - which is considered as dangerous as smoking (Better Health Channel n.d.). Being inactive for a long period of time could cause obesity, affect chronic health issues and even could cause several cancers (Better Health Channel n.d.).</h6><br> 
    <h6 class="w3-justify">Moreover, according to Degenhard (2021), the number of Vietnamese people that are overweight is predicted to increase over the years from 2010 to 2025, and this could be seen as alarming for our society when obesity has many serious negative effects on our body (Figure 17). Therefore, our application is produced with an aim to increase the awareness of obesity in Vietnam and decrease the overweight population ratio above (Figure 16), while supporting Vietnamese people who are suffering from obesity to overcome their bad habits and live a healthier life.</h6><br>

        <h6 class="w3-justify">With the busy, hustle and bustle of modern city life, Vietnam is rated among the most physically inactive countries around the world, thus accounting for the significant growth of obesity in recent years (Sen 2019). The risk is there, but not many people take their health conditions and changes in body shape into consideration, resulting in high blood pressure, heart diseases, stroke, anxiety, malnutrition, etc. that usually comes with obesity or underweight issues. Therefore, the aforementioned benefits of this 3D mobile scanning application to create real-looking digital models based on people’s real body measurements, helps users know exactly their BMI ratio, which parts of the body stores more fat and need weight control methods. After users have an overview of their body, suitable exercise and diet plans are proposed to help them control health daily in a methodical way. Oue team hopes that with this mobile application, people can daily check changes in their body shape, track progress and set target goals for their wanted body measurements. Also, they can save money and time going to hospital for annual check-ups whilst still getting in shape and living a healthy lifestyle.</h6><br>
