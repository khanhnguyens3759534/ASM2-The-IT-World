      <p class="w3-justify w3-col m7 w3-right w3-padding ">My name is Tran Thi Thuy Tien, and my student ID is 3825458. Presently, I am majoring in Human Resources Management (HRM) at RMIT university. I am an extrovert that really enjoys making new friends, therefore, I joined many clubs, such as RMIT Human Development Club which enables me to develop interpersonal skills and meet friends who share mutual interests. My enjoyment for IT started when I attended an online event that focused on how IT will affect HRM in the future. That’s when I realized the importance of technical skill and data analysis if I want to succeed with my future career path. Moreover, our team’s name is related to two of my interests right now: business and IT - with a desire to create and support other businesses with IT solutions in the future.

Therefore, RMIT is my destination as its Digital Marketing degree integrates both academic and hands-on practice excellently. Another reason I study Digital Marketing is because I always have a soft spot for technology, which explains why I chose a major which combines both marketing and technology. I consider myself as a creative yet logical person as well as a quick and diligent learner who is not afraid to embrace changes. Besides studying, I also applied for several jobs to nurture skills and knowledge. One of my proudest jobs is working as an intern for a famous Digital & Creative Marketing agency, in which I had the opportunity to collaborate with co-workers to use digital platforms and technology to support marketing strategies such as design, develop and code website, produce and render video, etc. The 6-month internship has fueled my motivation to explore more about the IT world, as I acknowledge marketing without technology will fail to impress the consumers and influence their buying behaviour. By enrolling in this course, I hope to broaden my knowledge about IT knowledge and its application in our daily lives.</p>

Currently, I am a final year student in RMIT with a major in Logistics & Supply chain management. I define myself as an outgoing and energetic person; besides, I am an progesstive person This could be illustrated clearly through my participation in two student clubs which are AIESEC and RMIT Business Club when I am a first-year student. Talking about my IT preference, I am super interested in neural networks and artificial intelligence (AI) in the IT industry. This interest originated from a “Business IT” course in RMIT in which I was given an assignment to research deeply about the application of demand planning in a furniture enterprise. Therefore, that assignment actually triggered my interest in how demand forecasting and demand sensing are applied in many industries in daily life. Since I still do not have any IT experience, I am trying my best to absorb more IT knowledge through the provision of IT-related courses on LinkedIn library or Cousera before having a chance to step into the IT working industry.

With that ID, every student can access every facility in RMIT. Since the second semester of 2021 ended, I started exploring and designing my career path during semester break. During the first week of semester break, I intentionally watched the video of Tinh Te’s workshop discussing the Data Analytics career path. Although I have not approached Information Technology before, I find it interesting, especially the Data aspect. Therefore, I am preparing to become a Business Analyst.

Being both a Logician with Thinker creativity, I am passionate about the analysing and brainstorming process, from which I could come up with innovative ideas with justification and rationale for the project idea part. With good critical-thinking ability and a high sense of commitment, I believe I can give the ideal solutions to many problems, and ensure everyone’s work will meet the highest standard. Besides, I am also a good listener thanks to the Learning test result. Thus, I could utilize this ability to foster the bonding and harmony among team members, avoiding unnecessary conflicts by listening respectfully to their ideas, making them feel heard and respected. With these aforementioned strengths and the collaboration with teammates who have different personalities like Nguyen, I hope to bring out the dynamism, equal contribution and respect to achieve the ultimate goal.

        <dl ></dl>Overall, these tests somehow express how I communicate and work with others in this stage of my life. I believe these tests will not influence my behavior on a team. I'm an Introvert and Extrovert is equal. It implies that between working with a team as in surface, I also spend time reflecting on my work, which I believe will help a lot in the group. Otherwise, I'm a Tactile learner who's willing to dive into the project more than just discussing a subject. Especially in IT, consulting and ready theory to find a solution are just not enough. Digging while doing something is the best way to find the error and directly fix it. Therefore, it could be a positive trait for me to work in a team. Finally, the openness score shows me as a person that thinks in a sophisticated and complex idea. However, I think it could be a good point in teamwork. With a broad way of thinking, I can gather all of the necessary information for the work.

        <h3 class="w3-opacity w3-left"><u>Topic</u></h3>
    </div>
    <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">Since technology is a field that is growing exponentially over time, it is easy that newcomers can get confused with specific majors. Thus, the focus of our attention is going to make a website for online learning. The expected outcome of our website is going to share general knowledge in the IT fields. Later on, specific skills and how to enter the profession in a particular major without making any confusion will be introduced. We name that project with a “4-Tech Academic Coding Website" and the website name is "4Tech", which has several meanings. Firstly, "4" represents four members of this first project followed with "Technology". It also means implicit in "for technology", which is all our effort for technology.</h5><br>
    <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">In order to achieve such things, having a strong knowledge of each particular field is a must. Initially, the general picture of this project heavily depends on the methodology of teaching, which means that a good programmer may not teach very well. Therefore, the main challenge of this project is how to validate that knowledge and demonstrate it in a friendly way. As a result, imparting knowledge efficiency and avoiding as many academic theories is vital to let beginners find interest in the course and later in their career paths. To implement those work successfully, consulting with professionals in our school and the advice of them is an essential part of the success of this project.</h5><br>
    <div class="w3-container w3-content w3-padding-10" style="max-width:1000px" >
        <h3 class="w3-opacity w3-left"><u>Motivation</u></h3>
    </div>
    <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">The motivation we have mainly from what we have experienced as a beginner. Enrolling in the field that contains too many subfields and the difficulty of its applications in the real-world made us come up with the idea of online teaching. Our project not only assists people to learn new things but also reduces the time-consume of getting to a specific place to learn. Tired of getting around will result in the efficiency of performance and produce less effectiveness in obtaining new knowledge. Therefore, students may feel free to control their schedules and activities and be more open with the course they enrolled in. Also, this project can help us form a solid knowledge base during teaching. To be precise, teaching is also a form of learning and reminds us about previous experience and skills we have passed. </h5><br>
    <div class="w3-container w3-content w3-padding-10" style="max-width:1000px" >
        <h3 class="w3-opacity w3-left"><u>Landscape</u></h3>
    </div>
    <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">The same idea of our projects is the Udemy website where people can purchase and join those courses. The courses in Udemy are various categories, in which the contributors are users. That platform has gained an enormous reputation for the success of learning online where their aim is professional adults and students, which means they have a wide range of customers. From the customer's standpoint, this platform is much more reliable compared to our website. However, because of the variety of categories and a bunch of courses and contributors, it is less likely that the quality of those courses can be good; therefore, our website will upgrade this point to meet customer’s desires. </h5><br>
    <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">Our website has many outstanding features that can attract newcomers and engage them in the course. Firstly, we provide a clear roadmap and a good vision for each online course that can let the pupil have a general view of what they are going to deal with and later in the future when they have finished this course. This action will keep them not confused and not get disoriented when they obtain new things. Secondly, providing tasks and questions after finishing each part of the courses may show their flaw in learning and let them revise the course again. Also, after they finish their course, there will be a small project for practicing and implementing some practical applications. It can be some projects that we have completed or some plans that others have done. This kind of work will make them engage and perform well later in the company. To end up, having a certificate of finishing this course, which is validated by some prestigious and quality organizations to ensure information and knowledge is adequate.</h5><br>

    </div>
    <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">In the age of technology, where more and more people want to learn more about the industry and to get their best in understanding it. During their process, they could head into some problems in their beginning stage. The aim of this project is to help new learners from all ages in the IT industry, coding to be specific, to achieve the basic knowledge of the coding language of their choice (Python, JAVA, HTML, etc.) and to create a platform that could help them strengthen their understanding in the language. Our aim for this project comes from our difficulties in learning experiences in the course, so we would want to help create something that could reduce the difficulties that most new learners can possibly come across. </h5><br>
    <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">Our goal for this project is to have a website that has a basic knowledge of coding languages (Python, HTML, JAVA, etc.). This section’s content will be researched and used with our knowledge gathered from lectures. The content will be checked and feedback by lecturers and students who achieved high achievements in the course, this will help increase the validity of our information in this section.</h5><br>
    <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">Besides, another goal for our website is that our website will have videos of basic guides on using the code. For this part, we will record our own use and test on the basic code. The recording will have the code segment and how the code will run alongside the explanation of the code use, which will be also checked and feedback by lectures. </h5><br>
    <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">Not only that, but our goal also includes a section that will provide the users who finished the course a certificate. The way we will do this is that we might connect to some centers or lectures in creating the certificate for the users. </h5><br>

    </div>
    <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">In the first group meeting, all of our team members have presented their ideas from assignment 1. While all of these intentions seem unique and potential, we found we lost to associate with each one. Besides, we all eager to learn and share knowledge correlated with the technology field for everyone, expand the engagement and understanding of people about the information technology industry. Since we have explored several perspectives of the information technology industry such as Web developer, IT Security, and Data Science, we have specific information about what necessitates to be equipped for training as well as the pathways that everyone can thrive in technology. While studying and researching in an information technology professional environment as well as ourselves as IT students, we understand and experience the difficulties and challenges when first approaching programming languages and skills to work with coding. Sometimes students lose direction and do not know where to start courses and how to achieve a good result that can be applied to work and practice in the computer industry. For these reasons, we wish to be able to support and provide a platform for sharing experiences and knowledge through lectures, knowledge sharing forum that the 4-Tech team has received in the learning process. With all that point of view, we aspire to establish a website in order to serve their demands, such as education, searching, and distribution. </h5><br>
    <div class="w3-container w3-content w3-padding-10" style="max-width:1000px" >
        <h4 class="w3-left"><i>Researching, Consulting, and Getting started:</i></h4>
    </div>
    <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">The 4-Tech team has come up with a specific 3-step plan to concretize ideas and divide this project into different phases and arrange them in a scientific order to improve project quality and achieve effective productivity. Brainstorming the idea of a project is the indispensable section in the first step not only of a plan but also the whole project in general. After getting an agreement on an idea, we began to research the concept. and consult and have a survey with current IT practitioners and researchers about the creativity and strengths and weaknesses of the idea of an online learning platform, which is the “4-Tech Academic Coding Website”. In order to achieve the schedule of the project as well as suit each member in the team, we decided to divide the whole team into two different divisions including a team responsible for the technical part of the project and one the department only focuses on the responsible content so that the content is appropriate for the educational environment. More specifically, look up the elements to make the website more unique, engaging, and effective than some existing platforms. This section will be illustrated in more detail in the progress section. </h5><br>

            <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">After agreeing on the idea of creating an IT academic website, each team member began to look up the factors based on these following questions:</h5><br>
            <div class="w3-container w3-content w3-padding-10" style="max-width:1000px" >
                <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left"><i>1. What are the famous websites that teach programming nowadays? </i></h5>
                <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left"><i>2. What are the similarities and differences between the above websites? Pros and cons? </i></h5>
                <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left"><i>3. What difficulty do students often encounter when accessing those websites for learning purposes?  </i></h5>
                <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left"><i>4. How can these problems be resolved? </i></h5>
                <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left"><i>And What makes our website distinctive and unique? </i></h5>
            </div>
            <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">While the core questions above solve the problem of the improvement of the 4-Tech website, we have to do primary research on people's learning on online websites:</h5><br>
            <div class="w3-container w3-content w3-padding-10" style="max-width:1000px" >
                <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left"><i>1. What are the difficulties of students when learning online programming?</i></h5>
                <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left"><i>2. Is the education path defined from the beginning?</i></h5>
                <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left"><i>3. After completing the course, is the student requiring credits? What is the purpose of those credits?</i></h5>
                <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left"><i>4. Are students willing to pay for a quality course?</i></h5>
            </div>
            <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">After finishing the primary and secondary research, the team members decided to begin. We convey this idea to our lecturers and some 2nd and 3rd-year students for their outlook and advice. In addition, we have also sent letters in order to perform this intention to many professors who have knowledge in the fields of information technology as well as education to obtain the best solution to implement this scheme. The advice and advice of experts and seniors will be recorded in the most specific way. These comments will be helpful for us to be able to evaluate the ideas that we have come up  with within the process from the beginning. Based on consultation minutes, we will give disadvantages and advantages when implementing this project to have timely corrections in the working process. We have received many deliberations upon the appearance of consult. Most of the evaluations give the problem our team is possessing and some clarifications. However, the most trustworthy answer is still our team striving to discover it and solve it.</h5><br>

        <div class="w3-container w3-content w3-padding-10" style="max-width:1000px" >
            <h4 class="w3-opacity w3-left"><i><u>a. Creating a general draft website design out of the academic coding website existing ideas:</u> </i></h4><br>
            <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">Through research and discussions, the 4-Tech team has decided to choose the ideas to provide an academic website platform for learning and sharing about programming knowledge for IT students in particular and everyone who has a passion for computer science in general. In order to seamlessly and logically incorporate these ideas into the project, a draft is needed to be easily visualized and to have a clear and concrete consistency.</h5>
            <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">Firstly, the 4-Tech team has started to work by creating a list of functions required on the website as well as the needs that users need to receive when using this online learning platform. This list plays an important role to design the outline structure of the 4-Tech academic coding website. We use this step to create a solid foundation when we start building a design structure draft of the website that has the most essential and complete elements.</h5><br>
            <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">Based on the checklists the technical team has listed, we have consulted many famous academic websites in various fields including w3schools.com, Cambly: English Tutors Online, and a variety of hand-drawn designs the structure of the site according to educational requirements. We create a draft by arranging the layout of the site with headers, page content, footers, and function keys in a reasonable way. 4-Tech has been meeting and discussing a lot to gather ideas and come up with a specific draft, which is used to build and program to create a modern, useful, and easy-to-use academic website platform. This draft operates our whole team to efficiently visualize and rely on it to be the accessibility to go through the next steps of the project to build a website.</h5>
            <br>
            <h4 class="w3-opacity w3-left"><i><u>b. Exploring some free academic or tutor HTML/CSS template online and choosing one of the most similar to the draft :</u></i></h4><br>
            <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">For the 4-Tech team, this is also the first time the group has been exposed and worked on a real project in the field of information technology. With the existing knowledge of the team members, completing the 4-Tech Academic Coding Website project will be very difficult and lack knowledge of web programming as well as the extensive libraries of this platform. It gets harder to create a complete website with as few errors as possible, and the 4-Tech team also has to work with the database that is the back-end of a web project. Due to the lack of knowledge and the pressure of time, our whole team got together and discussed making a decision to use one of the free and basic templates from the developers that publish the online to release the website demo of this project. </h5><br>
            <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">The technical team of 4-Tech has visited and explored one of the websites about HTML / CSS templates and many templates incorporating from famous programming languages like colorib.com, w3schools.com, and template.co. We are exposed to and observed many beautiful and very lively templates with many attractive effects to users. However, with the goal of providing a good learning experience and easy to use in keeping with the spirit of education, colorful and complex templates will not be appropriate.</h5><br>
            <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">To be easy in the selection we have set out 3 criteria: The first one must be one of the templates with a minimal design that is not too fussy in color. Next, especially we need a template that has a layout and design that closely resembles the ones we completed in the previous draft. In addition, our ultimate goal will be to be simple in programming so that parts of the content can be changed easily and not too complicatedly. By giving the criteria and combining them together, we have found 2-3 templates that match the above criteria. The rest we have to deliberate to choose the best sample and similar to what we have given the idea and design them in the draft. Having finished choosing the website template, the next step we need to edit and transform the template from other things belongs to the 4-Tech team. This is the part that requires critical thinking ability and basic HTML programming knowledge that we learned in the first weeks of the course, this is considered the decisive step for the success of the whole project.</h5><br>
            <div class="w3-container w3-content w3-padding-100 w3-center" style="max-width:1200px">
            <img src="Picture1.png" class="w3-mid-left w3-square" alt="IT picture" style="width:80%">
            </div>
            <br>
            <h4 class="w3-opacity w3-left"><i><u>c. Structure of the provided template:</u></i></h4><br>
            <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">Because of further maintenance and upgrading the system when there are more tasks and codes to contribute, we have to build the code and the files again.</h5><br>
            <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify"> First, the files need to be reconstructed in order so that when more files are added, programmers or contributors to the website can manage the system so that they do not get frustrated. For example, each HTML and CSS file needs to be separated in different folders named HTML or CSS to manage those files. Any similar structure or extension of the files should also separate because later there will be numerous things to handle.</h5><br>
            <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify"> Secondly, the code in each file should additionally be rebuilt for more straightforward to read. To illustrate, in CSS files, we have to convert the class name to a friendly name for us in order to maintain and keep track of the code, which hugely results in debugging issues. When the problem comes up in such a case that we might not even know it happens; therefore, writing efficient code can support programmers to detect it. For example, the chatbox of the website is not displaying on the screen for the first time, we have to traverse the code, marking errors and commands which would appear problems, then we fix it.</h5><br>
            <br>
            <h4 class="w3-opacity w3-left"><i><u>d. Upgrade and add new features:</u></i></h4><br>
            <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">When we use the template for our website, there is a lot of work to handle. One example is that we are going to fix the click button and its interface so that it looks more attractive. For instance, we add a link to the recruitment website based on the original box of the template. If the user clicks to images or titles of that box, the website will automatically open a new tab of that link. </h5><br>
            <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">However, fixing the website and its performance is a small part of our project. Since the template for our website is not enough, we have to add new features and contents for the project appropriately. To manage time effectively, we have found some attractive templates for our website such as chatbox for asking tutors about technical issues and comments for exchanging information about their projects as well as their difficulties in learning advanced topics. However, these templates also have some problems. </h5><br>
            <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">Concerning the chat box feature, the template we found holds a big size and does not have pop-ups movement, which is not suitable for chatting with their instructors and results terribly in user experience. Thus, we have to minimize the size of the chatbox and add popups animations. In the phase of adding new features, we have to consider whether it can crash our code or raise some error later, which would hardly be figured out in a short time. </h5><br>
            <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">About the comment feature, we currently use the comment of Facebook, which is constructed by Facebook for different websites. Users can post their comments through this section and discuss with others in their blogs, status, and their experience. This application is hugely helpful and minimizing the time of building on our own. These features can make the user experience better compared with the original of the template.</h5><br>
            <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">However, one of the limitations of our project, which is a website for learning online, is not having a real-time system where users can interact with others and instructors to boost their performance. Also, providing an account for each user to login is not available at this time since it requires databases for storing data and other skills of the back-end.</h5><br>

            <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">To prepare for the Academic section, we have to spend most of our time studying and determining the knowledge exceptionally thoroughly. We are meticulous in selecting the expertise and content in order to convey to the students. The Academic section is constructed up of small areas like Lectures, Video Tutoring, Exercise, and Specialized Vocabulary. The process of integrating the content of each division will be exhibited below:</h5>
            <div class="w3-container w3-content w3-padding-10" style="max-width:1000px" >
            <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">- Lectures: There are a lot of websites that teach programming in the form of lectures - all text. That makes it straightforward for apprentices to apprehend and keep up with the course in the way of documentation. 4 - Tech will also build the lesson partly in words. Still, it will be as clear, brief, and concise as possible, and obligation is complete and accurate. We have organized this content with our knowledge and at the same time refer to several platforms currently on the market such as Leetcode, W3school, Kaggle.</h5>
            <br>
            <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">- Video tutoring: Identifying the necessary between lectures and visual instructions assist students in absorbing and retaining information for a longer time. It is recommended to accompany detailed instructional videos attending the lectures. We will produce a video by recording the screen with the sound while the lecture was performing the examples in the lesson. Then apply the editing Videos software to alter the lecture content.</h5>
            <br>
            <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">- Exercises: Exercises attached below each lesson are intended for users to train. It is formulated by us in the form of the student inputting the answer, and the program outputs the result: True or false. Besides, there will be a section of solutions when users find it challenging to find the answer.</h5>
            <br>
           <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">- Specialized Vocabulary: In each lecture, there will be a number of specialized English words that students will meet again in the learning process. And the more classes, the more the abundance and multifariousness of words. Thus 4-tech synthesize some vocabulary students should learn that appear in that lecture.</h5>
            </div>
            <h4 class="w3-opacity w3-left"><i><u>b. Sharing</u></i></h4><br>
            <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">In this part, we would interview different people, which will include lecturers, former students of the courses from our university or maybe from other universities. The base information we would want to know from the interviewees are mostly about how did they start their journey in the Computer Science Industry, what or who had inspired them to be in this path. Besides that, we would also want them to share with us their experiences in finding their ideal way in this whole big industry of coding and which tools or how did they get help to achieve their goals. Not only that, we will also ask them about their plan after graduation, how they plan on finding jobs, how they find internship and apprenticeship programs. Another idea, which we would want to cover in the interview part is about their dream position in a company and which company they would like to work in. We would note down their answers and will be posted on our website.</h5><br>
            <br>
            <h4 class="w3-opacity w3-left"><i><u>c. News</u></i></h4><br>
            <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">For the reason that the character of the information technology industry is at all time innovating to access the most advanced feats, it is both an advantage and a weakness. In regards to the one hand, learners will be exposed to the most enthusiastic and most contemporary ones. On the other hand, they continuously have to absorb new information, keep up with the trend, avoid the old expertise compared to the present.</h5><br>
            <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">To the aim that students not to be bored with the lessons, as well as having the ability to absorb available advanced technologies, current developments related to the technology industry in the world, 4-Tech has decided to proceed to expose content for the News section.</h5><br>
            <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">In the process of determining technology articles, we initially looked for quality portals such as BBC News, The New York Times, The Guardian. Besides, technology newspapers such as Medium, Techcrunch, Wired also have valuable and impressive information in diverse domains of technology.</h5><br>
            <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">The numerous articles are read, and the News page on 4-Tech is striving to synthesize and publish the most competent features as well as the most beneficial and accurate information for readers.

If users click to either images or titles in a box, our website will open a new tab and direct them to the recruitment pages. To comment or chat with other users or lecturers of the course for some information, we have created a chatbox for asking lecturers and comments developed by Facebook for discussing in a blog or a forum.

        <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">The registration and login system when accessing the website is one of the important parts that we need to develop to have a perfect system and prevent licensing of lectures and videos posted on the website. The user system consists of a registration sequence of courses a user needs to register for an account including email and password and saves it in the website database. These user accounts are used to be able to participate in forums, news, and knowledge sharing among users. </h5><br>
        <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">The user database system can also be used to check and query the courses that students have completed, making it easy to come up with the criteria that can obtain course certificates. Moreover, the 4Tech Academic Coding Website platform has many shortcomings in the function buttons associated with programming lessons. The forum section should be optimized for creating a miniature social network that accepts questions related to programming and Information Technology related knowledge and is managed by the administrators.</h5><br>
        <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">The features that the 4-Tech Academic Coding website lacks on should have a good back-end system and an optimized database. However, to be able to develop this system requires a lot of time and a solid knowledge of web programming. With the knowledge that the 4-Tech team has, this will still be a big and limited challenge that our whole team needs time to learn and improve this system in the future.</h5><br>

        <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">The content of lessons and courses has yet to be appended because of the great number of courses we have introduced yet. For instance, Java, C, C++ required a long-term process to research and complete the lesson plan. Regarding the new informational articles that are still in the process of training since the reliability of several reports, our team needs time for confirming whether its articles' content  is true or not. Similarly the Credits and Qualifications sections, our team are going to get contact with many Universities and the Technical lab and after that, we also wait for them to admit our lectures.

        <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">For the construction of the 4-Tech Academic Coding Website structure and functionality, members of the 4-Tech team have used Pycharm (Version: 2020.2.1) software support tools to build HTML. In addition, to bring a professional website and a good user experience we need to use some additional libraries and web frameworks such as Foundation (version 6), Bootstrap (v4.5.2), CSS, and HTML5. </h5><br>
        <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">Adobe toolkit is necessary to design and edit the images and videos contained in the content of this website to bring beautiful graphics so that users can easily absorb and enjoy learning at the 4-Tech Academic Coding Website.
