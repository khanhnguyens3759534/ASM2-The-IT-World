      <p class="w3-justify w3-col m7 w3-right w3-padding ">My name is Tran Thi Thuy Tien, and my student ID is 3825458. Presently, I am majoring in Human Resources Management (HRM) at RMIT university. I am an extrovert that really enjoys making new friends, therefore, I joined many clubs, such as RMIT Human Development Club which enables me to develop interpersonal skills and meet friends who share mutual interests. My enjoyment for IT started when I attended an online event that focused on how IT will affect HRM in the future. That’s when I realized the importance of technical skill and data analysis if I want to succeed with my future career path. Moreover, our team’s name is related to two of my interests right now: business and IT - with a desire to create and support other businesses with IT solutions in the future.

Therefore, RMIT is my destination as its Digital Marketing degree integrates both academic and hands-on practice excellently. Another reason I study Digital Marketing is because I always have a soft spot for technology, which explains why I chose a major which combines both marketing and technology. I consider myself as a creative yet logical person as well as a quick and diligent learner who is not afraid to embrace changes. Besides studying, I also applied for several jobs to nurture skills and knowledge. One of my proudest jobs is working as an intern for a famous Digital & Creative Marketing agency, in which I had the opportunity to collaborate with co-workers to use digital platforms and technology to support marketing strategies such as design, develop and code website, produce and render video, etc. The 6-month internship has fueled my motivation to explore more about the IT world, as I acknowledge marketing without technology will fail to impress the consumers and influence their buying behaviour. By enrolling in this course, I hope to broaden my knowledge about IT knowledge and its application in our daily lives.</p>

Currently, I am a final year student in RMIT with a major in Logistics & Supply chain management. I define myself as an outgoing and energetic person; besides, I am an progesstive person This could be illustrated clearly through my participation in two student clubs which are AIESEC and RMIT Business Club when I am a first-year student. Talking about my IT preference, I am super interested in neural networks and artificial intelligence (AI) in the IT industry. This interest originated from a “Business IT” course in RMIT in which I was given an assignment to research deeply about the application of demand planning in a furniture enterprise. Therefore, that assignment actually triggered my interest in how demand forecasting and demand sensing are applied in many industries in daily life. Since I still do not have any IT experience, I am trying my best to absorb more IT knowledge through the provision of IT-related courses on LinkedIn library or Cousera before having a chance to step into the IT working industry.

With that ID, every student can access every facility in RMIT. Since the second semester of 2021 ended, I started exploring and designing my career path during semester break. During the first week of semester break, I intentionally watched the video of Tinh Te’s workshop discussing the Data Analytics career path. Although I have not approached Information Technology before, I find it interesting, especially the Data aspect. Therefore, I am preparing to become a Business Analyst.

Being both a Logician with Thinker creativity, I am passionate about the analysing and brainstorming process, from which I could come up with innovative ideas with justification and rationale for the project idea part. With good critical-thinking ability and a high sense of commitment, I believe I can give the ideal solutions to many problems, and ensure everyone’s work will meet the highest standard. Besides, I am also a good listener thanks to the Learning test result. Thus, I could utilize this ability to foster the bonding and harmony among team members, avoiding unnecessary conflicts by listening respectfully to their ideas, making them feel heard and respected. With these aforementioned strengths and the collaboration with teammates who have different personalities like Nguyen, I hope to bring out the dynamism, equal contribution and respect to achieve the ultimate goal.

        <dl ></dl>Overall, these tests somehow express how I communicate and work with others in this stage of my life. I believe these tests will not influence my behavior on a team. I'm an Introvert and Extrovert is equal. It implies that between working with a team as in surface, I also spend time reflecting on my work, which I believe will help a lot in the group. Otherwise, I'm a Tactile learner who's willing to dive into the project more than just discussing a subject. Especially in IT, consulting and ready theory to find a solution are just not enough. Digging while doing something is the best way to find the error and directly fix it. Therefore, it could be a positive trait for me to work in a team. Finally, the openness score shows me as a person that thinks in a sophisticated and complex idea. However, I think it could be a good point in teamwork. With a broad way of thinking, I can gather all of the necessary information for the work.

        <h3 ><i>What do Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies do</i></h3><br>
        <h6 class="w3-justify">Published in 2008, blockchain technology is divided into three phases of development. Firstly, for Blockchain 1.0, Bitcoin - the first generation of blockchain paradigm is created to introduce automated payments through decentralization (Swan 2015). Secondly, in Blockchain 2.0, Ethereum's Smart Contract is produced to automatically implement the contracts without any intermediaries (Reyna et al. 2018). Lastly, at the present, Blockchain 3.0 is described as publicly disseminated and widely distributed in the society (Lee 2019).Currently, blockchain can impact numerous industries to make it more effient and transparent. For financial companies, blockchain enables digital asset exchange (such as Bitcoin or Ethereum), detect fraud in trading, facilitate investment and money transfer, etc (Daley 2021). Regarding the healthcare sector, big data in blockchain allows doctors to secure sensitive information of patients and even share or display healthcare plans individually (Daley 2021). In the real-estate industry, real-time contracts are enabled in blockchain to ensure all the parties accountability and compliances. With IoT companies, blockchain is facilitated through software and microchip hardware to produce a product that  encrypts ledger data (IBM n.d.).</h6>

        <h3 ><i>The newest technology of Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies / The future of Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies in the next three years / The technology or development that support the future of Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies:</h6><br>
        <h6 class="w3-justify">According to a survey conducted by Deloitte in 2021, Blockchain and cryptocurrencies in the next three to ten years will revolutionize digital assets while replacing fiat money (Deloitte 2021). Specifically, financial services industries (FSI) are gradually employing blockchain solutions into their core business operations to create competitive advantages and increase scalability: application of blockchain technology to deposits, payments and funding is believed to be safe - it will create a new revenue stream for banks and the FSI. Moreover, the adoption of blockchain technology to voting is promising by using a specified blockchain code, voter can vote through their phones or computers instead of going to a venue and write their vote - an instantly verifiable result will appears, avoiding fraud or interference but  also can protect voter information (PWC n.d.). Besides, AI and blockchain technology could create the intelligent transport system (ITS) assisted data analysis and transmission among vehicles to reduce cost for supply chain management industry (Yuan & Wang 2016).</h6><br>
        <h6 class="w3-justify">Regarding cryptocurrencies, there are still many countries that consider crypto-related transactions as illegal. Therefore, in the future, it is expected that there will be a cryptocurrencies regulation and detailed guidelines to ensure safety for traders and investors (Haar 2021). Furthermore, with increasing interest in cryptocurrencies, experts predicted that it will be adopted broadly by many institutions, changing the digital landscape in the future (Haar 2021). For instance, financial technology companies like PayPal or automotive car companies like Tesla are allowing their users to pay for their products by Bitcoin (Newbery 2021). It is forecasted that other technological companies will gradually adopt this method of payment to everyday use and with increasing demand, cryptocurrencies are likely to advance its value.</h6><br>
        <h3 ><i>The possible impact of future Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies / The changes that are likely to be made by Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies / The type of people that can be affected by Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies:</i></h3><br>
        <h6 class="w3-justify">Accounting is the field that is likely to be impacted most by blockchain audit technology. As mentioned before, blockchain have the ability to fully keep track of the recordkeeping process: each of the transactions can be monitored from the first stage to processed, recorded and reported by blockchain technology. It is preferable that we should identify greater transparency regarding auditing financial statements - to efficiently extract data and analysis. With blockchain audit technology, auditor professionals are given a chance to access real-time data via nodes of blockchain - enabling them to have a structured and consistent format of information (Deloitte 2017).</h6><br>
        <h6 class="w3-justify">Therefore, the business processes and business models in the future are likely to be revolutionized, moreover, job descriptions and skill sets of Certified Public Accountants (CPA) might be redefined as the emergence of the blockchain ecosystem. According to Deloitte (2017), there are several possible future roles for CPA - replacing the traditional roles - to be adaptable with the blockchain ecosystem: CPA will need to study and comprehend the technical programming language, or understand the mechanism of blockchain to become the auditor of smart contracts that is embedded in blockchain system. Hence, CPA professionals need to embrace this advanced technology, and are encouraged to be aware of the skills and qualifications that are needed in order to meet the market demand, otherwise, they would be replaced and become redundant in the fast-paced world of technological advancement.</h6><br>
        <h3 ><i>Effect of Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies on me / Effect of Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies on my family and friends:</i></h3><br>
        <h6 class="w3-justify">It is noteworthy that the blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies are transforming and revolutionizing our world at a fast-paced pace. Although the concept of paying Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies instead of cash is still unfamiliar to some people, I still believe that blockchain technology will make that easier and more convenient to our lives. In the future, I think me and my friends - who are genuine tech savvy - will buy cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin to use for everyday transactions instead of cash or credit cards. This is because blockchain has strict privacy protection and a protocol to help me with easier money transactions or exchange, so that me and my family do not need to go to the bank or register for a credit card to authenticate myself. Moreover, the blockchain-based social platforms priorities users control has made me feel very comfortable since it enables end-to-end encryption that would carefully protect my personal identities. In stark contrast, the current popular social media platforms are known for manipulating its user information for higher profit. Therefore, in the future, I think I would convince my family members to switch to decentralized social platforms - to secure personal data.</h6><br>
        <h6 class="w3-justify">Furthermore, according to recent studies of Guardian Seascape, 36% of fish were mislabelled and lack transparency (Leahy 2021). However, IBM has collaborated with many food companies to address this issue: they would integrate blockchain technology to supply chain management (SCM) industry - to provide clear information for the products and avoid mislabelled (Terra Pass 2021). Therefore, in the future, me and my family would find it easier to keep track of the product that we are using, for instance, which pesticide is used for our vegetables, or the origin of the vegetable and also can make cryptocurrencies payment for the farmers directly through decentralized system.</h6>

      <h1 class="w3-opacity w3-left"><i>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</i></h1>
    </div>
    <div class="w3-container w3-content w3-padding-10 w3-opacity"  style="max-width:900px">
        <h3 ><i>What does Artificial Intelligence do?</i></h3><br>
        <h6 class="w3-justify">Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a computer system that performs human activities based on the nine ordinary human bits of intelligence: problem-solving, perception, natural language communication, motion and manipulation, learning, representing knowledge, planning, social awareness and skills, and general intelligence (Rahman 2020). However, general AI can apply to a wide variety of activities. Therefore, many researchers have broken AI down into pieces to understand AI properly. They have come up with narrow AI building blocks that are used today and in the future, no matter how sophisticated the system is since it is focused on performing a specific task. Below are 4 characteristics of narrow AI and its applications. As a consequence, AI has two types: Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI), known as Weak AI, and Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), known as Strong AI.</h6><br>
        <h6 class="w3-justify">Machine Learning plays as a subset of AI. It is defined that it has the ability to gain new knowledge by generalizing examples and experience and performing its activities without programming (Kim 2020). As it is said that machine learning has the ability to gain new experience, how do computers learn new things? According to Rapidapi (2020), computers learn new things when they analyze data. For instance, in the marketing sector, computers analyze the shopping pattern of customers and based on that information, they can provide predictions for the development trend of the business.</h6><br>
        <img src="Motivation image.PNG" class="" alt="The predicting of overweight Vietnamese people" style="width:80%">
        <h3 ><i>What is the likely impact ? What is the potential impact of this development? What is likely to change? Which people will be most affected and how? Will this create, replace or make redundant any current jobs or technologies?</i></h3><br>
        <h6 class="w3-justify">The impacts of machine learning and its subset, deep learning, is nearly in every aspect of our lives. It could be applied shopping, study, entertainment, etc. One of the potential impacts is shopping behaviour, where customers have a trend to purchase goods through online apps. AI systems recommend similar products and essential materials for users where they can pay less time searching for their likes. As a result, this method changes the way they buy their products and reduce the time for going shopping.</h6><br>
        <h6 class="w3-justify">However, those applications can never be enough, AI applications must have to do more. In healthcare, AI can help doctors diagnose disease for patients with high accuracy, support them with information about symptoms and advise them whenever they make mistakes. Also, robots take care for patients to help doctors follow the current status of the patients more quickly. This application will reduce unwanted issues when doctors and nurses are overloaded with the outbreak of diseases and increase a better service for patients. Currently, some researchers are working on a project by applying AI in remote surgery and using nanotechnology to cure cancer cases</h6><br>
        <h6 class="w3-justify">If that application is highly successful, a milestone in healthcare will appear. Jobs for doctors will not be replaced by the advanced machine, in other words, it will reduce the complexity for people to follow this path. Since a doctor must learn and practice from university for even more than ten years before getting an official job, therefore, jobs for this role less than others because it requires a great effort, time, energy. With AI applications, it will support doctors to do their professionals better and make fewer mistakes before coming up with the final decisions.</h6><br>
        <h3><i>How will this affect you? In your daily life, how will this affect you? What will be different for you? How might this affect members of your family or your friends?</i></h3><br>
        <h6 class="w3-justify">Machine learning, an AI application, has a huge impact on my daily lives. As I prefer shopping online, it gives me a great experience of buying online products and enjoying entertainment by myself. Searching for one product can take a lot of time but with recommendations of AI of similar features and products, are very useful for searching for my likes.</h6><br>
        <h6 class="w3-justify">For my family, my parents can have a good service of AI application when they become older, they are able to be treated and cured with advanced technology. When my family suffers from the illness, robots or advanced services of AI help doctors to find a cure and increase the survival chance.</h6><br>
        <h6 class="w3-justify">When I am playing games with friends, machine learning applications in games can make the match become more interesting. In detail, playing statistical games in a group can help players increase their connections and training a team fight with other competitors, in this case, is AI.</h6><br>

        <h3 ><i>What does it do? What is the state of the art of this new technology?</i></h3><br>
        <h6 class="w3-justify">According to ICRA (International Conference on Robotics and Automation) Workshop video published in January 2020 [10], robots now have been developed to have legs so that they can walk on their own and have automatic API to help them work on a specific task automatically. Those robots were created to have the ability to scan and evaluate the environment that they are placed in using a camera or having a 2D distance sensor and built with different functions such as helping humans in construction sites (carrying objects, drilling nails, etc.) or even helping patients in rehabilitation centres learn to walk again, this robot type is called the Wandercraft. Besides that, Boston Dynamics had created a robot which they called the Atlas, the world's most humanoid robot [11]. Atlas also has the ability to demonstrate human-level agility as it has a total of 28 hydraulic joints and it’s movement speed can reach upto 1.5 m/s.</h6><br>
        <h3 ><i>What can be done now? </i></h3><br>
        <h6 class="w3-justify">At this point of time, where humans use robots for different functions and different purposes in different industries that we have right now. For example, MIT had invented a robot called “Mini cheetah” to demonstrate the movement of the cheetah autonomously with the max speed of up upto 2.5 m/s [12]. In the hospitality industry, Japan had been using robots to run a hotel. This hotel - Henn na Hotel, has almost everything run automatically [13]. In Singapore, researchers had found a way to create robots that can put together IKEA furniture [14]. The way the robot works is similar to human’s. First it will need to have visuals on the parts and then calculate the steps needed to assemble the finished product. In medical field, where robots are used to increase efficiency at work with these types, hospital robots - which are used to distribute medications, lab specimens and sensitive materials around the hospital, surgical robots - used in open operation with mechanical arms with a camera and/or surgical equipment attached to them, which are controlled by a surgeon [15].</h6><br>
        <h3 ><i>What is likely to be done soon (say in the next 3 years)? What technological or other developments make this possible?</i></h3><br>
        <h6 class="w3-justify">In the future, robots may be used to replace humans more for these types of jobs such as delivering/shipping items from one place to another. For this to happen in the future, researchers need to combine current technologies like GPS to help the robot navigate the suitable routes, self driving or flexible mobility to support the machine on its journey, and environmental awareness so it can make the right decisions to the robot, so it can work autonomously on its own. Besides that, robots can be used in the police force to combat in order to reduce casualties to human officers in dangerous missions as robots are less vulnerable. This could be possible as now humanoid robots are now being produced and put to test their abilities and in the future, those robots will may have enough requirements to be put on to the work. Robots can be decided to be built by materials that are strong enough to withstand the damaging effects of most common lethal weapons but still doesn’t affect their mobility</h6><br>
        <h3 ><i>What is the likely impact? What is the potential impact of this development? What is likely to change? Which people will be most affected and how? Will this create, replace or make redundant any current jobs or technologies?</i></h3><br>
        <h6 class="w3-justify">The increase of use of robots has brought a lot of impacts on different areas of life. Firstly, we have the factory manufacturing industry area. Robots help increase productivity growth, as in the manial working area required the workforce’s productivity to be constant with less workers needed as possible, this is when robots take part in. On the negative side, the invention of robots can have a lot of impacts on the life of humans as time goes on because new technologies come with new advanced, innovative robots. This means that a lot of workers can lose their jobs as the comparison between robots and humans efficiency in working in factories show that with the same amount of products produced required more human efforts than using robots, so they are now having robots to do repetition jobs in factories. But on the other side, it helps create more and more high-paying jobs which require more skilled-workers with more knowledge to do higher-valued works such as quality-related tasks which are more suitable to humans with skills . This means that people need to have higher education levels to be employed to be part of the workforce, increasing a person’s knowledge. Secondly, the increase in the amount of robots is directly proportional to the increase productivity depending on the purpose of the robots, which is also directly proportional to the increase in gross domestic product (GDP) of a country [16]. </h6><br>
        <h3 ><i>How will this affect you? In your daily life, how will this affect you? What will be different for you? How might this affect members of your family or your friends?</i></h3><br>
        <h6 class="w3-justify">For my daily life, robots could bring me a lot of benefits when I bring them into use. For example, in my house, my mom has a cleaning robot to help her do the chores, the robot will go around the house to vacuum the floor. The robot has a built in memory where it records the house’s layout so it can create a cleaning route every time put into use. The benefit this robot brings is that I can spend less time doing the cleaning and I don’t need to put in a lot of effort as most of the cleaning has been done, I only need to clean those spots that were missed out by the robot and only need to empty the dust bag of the robot after two or three days. For my family, this robot is really handy as we have three cats in total, the problem of cats is that their fur can fall everywhere around the floor so we just need to use the machine to vacuum all the fur as it is similar to dust. Besides that, when the machine was put to use the cats enjoy playing with the machine. In conclusion, the robot that my family has is beneficial to not only humans but to pets too.</h6><br>

        <h6 class="w3-justify">To understand the milestone shifts in autonomous driving, here are some related concepts. The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE), defines the intelligence and motorization capabilities of vehicles for levels from 0 to 5: [17]</h6>
        <div class="w3-container w3-content w3-padding-10" style="max-width:800px">
            <ul>
                <li><h6>Level 0: Fully manual vehicle</h6></li>
                <li><h6>Level 1: One single automated aspect</h6></li>
                <li><h6>Level 2: Automated steering and acceleration capabilities</h6></li>
                <li><h6>Level 3: Environment detection</h6></li>
                <li><h6>Level 4: No human interaction required</h6></li>
                <li><h6>Level 5: Human driving is eliminated</h6></li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <h6 class="w3-justify">Autonomous car leaders have presented Level 4- the vehicle can independently perform all driving duties and control the driving circumstances – mostly, do all the driving – in certain conditions. The human does not need to be concentrated [18]. But the only program in some standard road conditions, good weather. Besides, customers can now experience autonomous driving at level 3, such as the Audi A8. The automatic steering system structure is made up of software and sensors which can identify obstacles, signs, and people in transportation. Machine learning, lidar projectors, radar, and ultrasonic sensors all work together to create a living map of the world that a self-driving car can navigate.[19]</h6><br>

        <h3 ><i>What can be done now? </i></h3><br>
        <h6 class="w3-justify">It is presently attainable to implement technologies of autonomous driving models in medical, transportation, institutional, or computing surroundings. </h6>
        <h6 class="w3-justify">Tech organizations have processed a lot of experimentation to broaden the area of automated driving equipment. Hence, Google and Apple have poured capital into motor vehicle companies to alter communities' moving habits. Besides, Tesla also invested massively in autonomous vehicles to conquer tension when in traffic. [20]</h6>
        <h6 class="w3-justify">By applying design features to diversify, standard self-driving systems formulate and sustain a unique outline of their surroundings based on a comprehensive arrangement of sensors, such as radars. At various stages, Google's criteria have utilized radar, lasers, high-powered cameras, and sonar. Uber's self-driving prototypes apply sixty-four laser beams and other sensors, to construct their internal map.[21] </h6><br>
        <h3 ><i>What is likely to be done soon (in the next 3 years)?</i></h3><br>
        <h6 class="w3-justify">Discussing the near development's future of autonomous vehicles, this is divided into two milestones: Cars in 2022 and the capability of AV( autonomous vehicles) in 2024.</h6><br>
        <div class="w3-container w3-content w3-padding-10" style="max-width:800px">
            <ul>
                <li><h6>Cars in 2020:  While the Japanese car-makers aim to institute themselves as a pacesetter in driverless technologies, Nissan Motor Co. announces it's striving to propose entirely autonomous transportations to the business in 2022.[22]</h6></li>
                <li><h6>The capability of AV in 2024:  Mercedes-Benz and BMW have announced that they would make cooperation to process the AV for particular clients beginning in 2024. They also collaborate with Nvidia to develop the current technology. Constructing an innovative software-defined computing structure for motorized transportations relies on Nvidia's inherent program. It is said that future automated parking functions by Mercedes that utilize this method could propose up to Level 4, which expects the vehicle could go park on its own.[23]</h6></li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <br>
        <h3 ><i>What technological or other developments make this possible?</i></h3><br>
        <h6 class="w3-justify">To make the innovation come to actual Machine Learning Methods plays a vital role. Several prototypes of machine learning algorithms are being applied for various utilization in autonomous transports. This system concludes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) are the standard, in-depth learning methodologies connected to autonomous driving.</h6>
        <h6 class="w3-justify">CNN is primarily utilized to concoct images and spatial data to extract innovations to identify the environment's intentions.</h6>
        <h6 class="w3-justify">RNNs are essential devices for working with mundane data, like videos.</h6>
        <h6 class="w3-justify">DRL mixes Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning. This system allows software-defined 'agents' to determine the potential activities to accomplish their purposes, applying a premium capacity.[24]</h6><br>
        <h3 ><i>What is the likely impact? What is the potential impact of this development? What is likely to change? Which people will be most affected and how? Will this create, replace or make redundant any current jobs or technologies?</i></h3><br>
        <h6 class="w3-justify">For demonstrating the influence of AI in general and Autonomous vehicles in specific to life,  It would be how AV combat with the 19 coronaviruses. Because of the pandemic's emergency, almost all cities in China lockdown, and people have to minimize face-to-face associations. Hence, AI, big data, and robot services are applied to restrict the virus.  To satisfy the demanded victuals, medicals, China requires maintenance from autonomous vehicles.</h6>
        <h6 class="w3-justify">Therefore, Chinese carmakers have to push their products to supply automatic equipment adequately. And of course, people in the pandemic's area are remarkably affected by the benefit of AV. </h6>
        <h6 class="w3-justify">Many autopilot devices are equipped with cameras and notifications sections, to substitute guards, to remind people to wear masks, and keep distance in public. According to the MIT Technology Review, one of the administrators in autonomous vehicle technology, Baidu, has published 104 driverless means of transport in 17 cities. These transportations perform priority anti-epidemic tasks like washing, sanitizing, logistics, and delivering. [25]</h6>
        <h6 class="w3-justify">Another vital influence is reducing personal time spending on driving, safety, and decreasing traffic congestion:</h6>
        <div class="w3-container w3-content w3-padding-10" style="max-width:800px">
            <ul>
                <li><h6>Unsimilar to the original car, drivers have to spend all their time focusing on driving. Traveling with AV, drivers easily engage in other activities, such as communicating, reading news. Hence, they utilize their free time productively.</h6></li>
                <li><h6>More than 40% of fatal 38 crashes involve drink, disturbance, pill involvement, and tiredness (NHTSA 2012) [26]. With this problem, AVs potentially degrade crashes dramatically and keep traffic participation safer.</h6></li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <h6 class="w3-justify">It is said that reducing traffic congestion as a result of safety while driving. The more accidents are minimized, the more blank-space for vehicles. The existence of AV will affect two sides of current jobs including good side and bad side:</h6>
        <div class="w3-container w3-content w3-padding-10" style="max-width:800px">
            <ul>
                <li><h6><u>Good side:</u> The AV's companies hire more engineers, Developers, Designers. It would need more people who have knowledge and experience in autonomous driving for doing sales and testing.</h6></li>
                <li><h6><u>Bad side:</u> Some jobs like drivers, chauffeurs will be negatively affected because of automatic cars. Additionally, the driving trainee industry also is the same.</h6></li>
            </ul>

        <h3 ><i>How will this affect you? In your daily life, how will this affect you? What will be different for you? How might this affect members of your family or your friends?</i></h3><br>
        <h6 class="w3-justify">With the development of AVs, I see both the positives and negatives that automation brings.</h6>
        <div class="w3-container w3-content w3-padding-10" style="max-width:800px">
            <ul>
                <li><h6><u>Positive:</u></h6></li>
                <h6>As the current epidemic situation, AVs, as mentioned above, will be an essential 'weapon' to support people fight against viruses. It will serve as a mechanism of substituting people with moving, buying food, and making medical reports.</h6>
                <h6>Driving for everyone will become safer and more relaxed. Accidents will additionally occur less frequently, thereby decreasing traffic congestion.</h6>
                <h6>The family members will have more time to communicate, join each other instead of entirely focusing on driving.</h6>
                <li><h6><u>Negative:</u></h6></li>
                <h6>Because of the convenience of driving with an automated vehicle, people will become distracted from their safety as well as others.</h6>
                <h6>The situation of drunken traffic in transportation will rise because of some AVs' placement, the amount of alcohol and drugs will be consumed more, and that is harmful to human health.</h6>
                <h6>While the autopilot will help degrade traffic jams, it will also progress the fuel consumed by cars because cars will travel faster, thereby harmful to the green environment.</h6>
                <li><h6><u>Summary:</u></h6></li>
                <h6>Currently, I have realized that the improvement of AVs would still bring people more benefits than harm. It plays an essential role in humanity into a new era where there are not only autonomous moving devices but machines that can assist people in other aspects of activities such as medicine, education, mechanical. From my point of view, at present, AVs are still not suitable for Vietnam because of the topography of Vietnam and the situation in traffic participation as well as the habits of using Vietnamese means of transportation.</h6>

    </div>
    <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">The idea of our project is the combination from two of our members: Tien and Chau. In the first assignment, Tien has proposed an application that could support people who can not afford gym fees with home workout plans and healthy meals to help them lose weight at home, instead of going to public places that could be dangerous in the COVID-19 pandemic scenario. Meanwhile, Chau has come up with a platform ‘Smart Health Prediction’ - which patients can input their health conditions so that AI can predict their current state of disease and receive appropriate guidance.</h5><br>
    <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">However, the field of health care has a lot of types of disease, and we are not the expertise in that field, so we decided to narrow down our scope to obesity. Particularly, our application will have two special features: the Augmented Reality feature would be used to scan user’s body and predict which muscle group on their body will need to be improved, and the Artificial Intelligence feature will automatically calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI) - a weight-to-height ratio that can be used to indicate whether a person is overweight or underweight - based on the input of users about their current weight and height.</h5><br>
    <div class="w3-container w3-content w3-padding-10" style="max-width:1000px" >
        <h3 class="w3-opacity w3-left"><u>Motivation</u></h3>
    </div>
    <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">The determination of our team in building this project is that we care about people’s health. As we are still young and have many times to workout to improve health, instead of staying in bed or sitting at one place for too long - which is considered as dangerous as smoking (Better Health Channel n.d.). Being inactive for a long period of time could cause obesity, affect chronic health issues and even could cause several cancers (Better Health Channel n.d.). </h5><br>
    <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">Moreover, according to Degenhard (2021), the number of Vietnamese people that are overweight is predicted to increase over the years from 2010 to 2025, and this could be seen as alarming for our society when obesity has many serious negative effects on our body (Figure Y). Therefore, our application is produced with an aim to increase the awareness of obesity in Vietnam and decrease the overweight population ratio above (Figure ), while supporting Vietnamese people who are suffering from obesity to overcome their bad habits and live a healthier life. </h5><br>

The courses in Udemy are various categories, in which the contributors are users. That platform has gained an enormous reputation for the success of learning online where their aim is professional adults and students, which means they have a wide range of customers. From the customer's standpoint, this platform is much more reliable compared to our website. However, because of the variety of categories and a bunch of courses and contributors, it is less likely that the quality of those courses can be good; therefore, our website will upgrade this point to meet customer’s desires. </h5><br>
    <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">Our website has many outstanding features that can attract newcomers and engage them in the course. Firstly, we provide a clear roadmap and a good vision for each online course that can let the pupil have a general view of what they are going to deal with and later in the future when they have finished this course. This action will keep them not confused and not get disoriented when they obtain new things. Secondly, providing tasks and questions after finishing each part of the courses may show their flaw in learning and let them revise the course again. Also, after they finish their course, there will be a small project for practicing and implementing some practical applications. It can be some projects that we have completed or some plans that others have done. This kind of work will make them engage and perform well later in the company. To end up, having a certificate of finishing this course, which is validated by some prestigious and quality organizations to ensure information and knowledge is adequate.</h5><br>

            To be more specific, our testing process would be conducted in the following steps: 
            Step 1: Data collection.
            In this step, both raw dataset and processed dataset are necessarily required (i.e. age, gender, diet, the frequency of exercise etc). Indeed, since there exist a numerous number of data types needed, the critical processes such as data cleaning, data integration should be conducted in the most efficient way. 
            Step 2: Applying ML algorithms 
            Step 3: Algorithms’ evaluation.</h5><br>

            <h4 class="w3-opacity w3-left"><i><u>a. Creating a general draft website design out of the academic coding website existing ideas:</u> </i></h4><br>
            <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">Through research and discussions, the 4-Tech team has decided to choose the ideas to provide an academic website platform for learning and sharing about programming knowledge for IT students in particular and everyone who has a passion for computer science in general. In order to seamlessly and logically incorporate these ideas into the project, a draft is needed to be easily visualized and to have a clear and concrete consistency.</h5>
            <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">Firstly, the 4-Tech team has started to work by creating a list of functions required on the website as well as the needs that users need to receive when using this online learning platform. This list plays an important role to design the outline structure of the 4-Tech academic coding website. We use this step to create a solid foundation when we start building a design structure draft of the website that has the most essential and complete elements.</h5><br>
            <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">Based on the checklists the technical team has listed, we have consulted many famous academic websites in various fields including w3schools.com, Cambly: English Tutors Online, and a variety of hand-drawn designs the structure of the site according to educational requirements. We create a draft by arranging the layout of the site with headers, page content, footers, and function keys in a reasonable way. 4-Tech has been meeting and discussing a lot to gather ideas and come up with a specific draft, which is used to build and program to create a modern, useful, and easy-to-use academic website platform. This draft operates our whole team to efficiently visualize and rely on it to be the accessibility to go through the next steps of the project to build a website.</h5>
            <br>
            <h4 class="w3-opacity w3-left"><i><u>b. Exploring some free academic or tutor HTML/CSS template online and choosing one of the most similar to the draft :</u></i></h4><br>
            <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">For the 4-Tech team, this is also the first time the group has been exposed and worked on a real project in the field of information technology. With the existing knowledge of the team members, completing the 4-Tech Academic Coding Website project will be very difficult and lack knowledge of web programming as well as the extensive libraries of this platform. It gets harder to create a complete website with as few errors as possible, and the 4-Tech team also has to work with the database that is the back-end of a web project. Due to the lack of knowledge and the pressure of time, our whole team got together and discussed making a decision to use one of the free and basic templates from the developers that publish the online to release the website demo of this project. </h5><br>
            <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">The technical team of 4-Tech has visited and explored one of the websites about HTML / CSS templates and many templates incorporating from famous programming languages like colorib.com, w3schools.com, and template.co. We are exposed to and observed many beautiful and very lively templates with many attractive effects to users. However, with the goal of providing a good learning experience and easy to use in keeping with the spirit of education, colorful and complex templates will not be appropriate.</h5><br>
            <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">To be easy in the selection we have set out 3 criteria: The first one must be one of the templates with a minimal design that is not too fussy in color. Next, especially we need a template that has a layout and design that closely resembles the ones we completed in the previous draft. In addition, our ultimate goal will be to be simple in programming so that parts of the content can be changed easily and not too complicatedly. By giving the criteria and combining them together, we have found 2-3 templates that match the above criteria. The rest we have to deliberate to choose the best sample and similar to what we have given the idea and design them in the draft. Having finished choosing the website template, the next step we need to edit and transform the template from other things belongs to the 4-Tech team. This is the part that requires critical thinking ability and basic HTML programming knowledge that we learned in the first weeks of the course, this is considered the decisive step for the success of the whole project.</h5><br>

            <br>
            <h4 class="w3-opacity w3-left"><i><u>c. Structure of the provided template:</u></i></h4><br>
            <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">Because of further maintenance and upgrading the system when there are more tasks and codes to contribute, we have to build the code and the files again.</h5><br>
            <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify"> First, the files need to be reconstructed in order so that when more files are added, programmers or contributors to the website can manage the system so that they do not get frustrated. For example, each HTML and CSS file needs to be separated in different folders named HTML or CSS to manage those files. Any similar structure or extension of the files should also separate because later there will be numerous things to handle.</h5><br>
            <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify"> Secondly, the code in each file should additionally be rebuilt for more straightforward to read. To illustrate, in CSS files, we have to convert the class name to a friendly name for us in order to maintain and keep track of the code, which hugely results in debugging issues. When the problem comes up in such a case that we might not even know it happens; therefore, writing efficient code can support programmers to detect it. For example, the chatbox of the website is not displaying on the screen for the first time, we have to traverse the code, marking errors and commands which would appear problems, then we fix it.</h5><br>
            <br>
            <h4 class="w3-opacity w3-left"><i><u>d. Upgrade and add new features:</u></i></h4><br>
            <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">When we use the template for our website, there is a lot of work to handle. One example is that we are going to fix the click button and its interface so that it looks more attractive. For instance, we add a link to the recruitment website based on the original box of the template. If the user clicks to images or titles of that box, the website will automatically open a new tab of that link. </h5><br>
            <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">However, fixing the website and its performance is a small part of our project. Since the template for our website is not enough, we have to add new features and contents for the project appropriately. To manage time effectively, we have found some attractive templates for our website such as chatbox for asking tutors about technical issues and comments for exchanging information about their projects as well as their difficulties in learning advanced topics. However, these templates also have some problems. </h5><br>
            <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">Concerning the chat box feature, the template we found holds a big size and does not have pop-ups movement, which is not suitable for chatting with their instructors and results terribly in user experience. Thus, we have to minimize the size of the chatbox and add popups animations. In the phase of adding new features, we have to consider whether it can crash our code or raise some error later, which would hardly be figured out in a short time. </h5><br>
            <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">About the comment feature, we currently use the comment of Facebook, which is constructed by Facebook for different websites. Users can post their comments through this section and discuss with others in their blogs, status, and their experience. This application is hugely helpful and minimizing the time of building on our own. These features can make the user experience better compared with the original of the template.</h5><br>
            <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">However, one of the limitations of our project, which is a website for learning online, is not having a real-time system where users can interact with others and instructors to boost their performance. Also, providing an account for each user to login is not available at this time since it requires databases for storing data and other skills of the back-end.</h5><br>

            <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">To prepare for the Academic section, we have to spend most of our time studying and determining the knowledge exceptionally thoroughly. We are meticulous in selecting the expertise and content in order to convey to the students. The Academic section is constructed up of small areas like Lectures, Video Tutoring, Exercise, and Specialized Vocabulary. The process of integrating the content of each division will be exhibited below:</h5>
            <div class="w3-container w3-content w3-padding-10" style="max-width:1000px" >
            <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">- Lectures: There are a lot of websites that teach programming in the form of lectures - all text. That makes it straightforward for apprentices to apprehend and keep up with the course in the way of documentation. 4 - Tech will also build the lesson partly in words. Still, it will be as clear, brief, and concise as possible, and obligation is complete and accurate. We have organized this content with our knowledge and at the same time refer to several platforms currently on the market such as Leetcode, W3school, Kaggle.</h5>
            <br>
            <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">- Video tutoring: Identifying the necessary between lectures and visual instructions assist students in absorbing and retaining information for a longer time. It is recommended to accompany detailed instructional videos attending the lectures. We will produce a video by recording the screen with the sound while the lecture was performing the examples in the lesson. Then apply the editing Videos software to alter the lecture content.</h5>
            <br>
            <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">- Exercises: Exercises attached below each lesson are intended for users to train. It is formulated by us in the form of the student inputting the answer, and the program outputs the result: True or false. Besides, there will be a section of solutions when users find it challenging to find the answer.</h5>
            <br>
           <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">- Specialized Vocabulary: In each lecture, there will be a number of specialized English words that students will meet again in the learning process. And the more classes, the more the abundance and multifariousness of words. Thus 4-tech synthesize some vocabulary students should learn that appear in that lecture.</h5>
            </div>
            <h4 class="w3-opacity w3-left"><i><u>b. Sharing</u></i></h4><br>
            <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">In this part, we would interview different people, which will include lecturers, former students of the courses from our university or maybe from other universities. The base information we would want to know from the interviewees are mostly about how did they start their journey in the Computer Science Industry, what or who had inspired them to be in this path. Besides that, we would also want them to share with us their experiences in finding their ideal way in this whole big industry of coding and which tools or how did they get help to achieve their goals. Not only that, we will also ask them about their plan after graduation, how they plan on finding jobs, how they find internship and apprenticeship programs. Another idea, which we would want to cover in the interview part is about their dream position in a company and which company they would like to work in. We would note down their answers and will be posted on our website.</h5><br>

            <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">For the reason that the character of the information technology industry is at all time innovating to access the most advanced feats, it is both an advantage and a weakness. In regards to the one hand, learners will be exposed to the most enthusiastic and most contemporary ones. On the other hand, they continuously have to absorb new information, keep up with the trend, avoid the old expertise compared to the present.</h5><br>
            <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">To the aim that students not to be bored with the lessons, as well as having the ability to absorb available advanced technologies, current developments related to the technology industry in the world, 4-Tech has decided to proceed to expose content for the News section.</h5><br>
            <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">In the process of determining technology articles, we initially looked for quality portals such as BBC News, The New York Times, The Guardian. Besides, technology newspapers such as Medium, Techcrunch, Wired also have valuable and impressive information in diverse domains of technology.</h5><br>
            <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">The numerous articles are read, and the News page on 4-Tech is striving to synthesize and publish the most competent features as well as the most beneficial and accurate information for readers.

Occasionally, we would set up a quick call session around 15 - 30 minutes to catch up with each other if we can’t meet face to face. We also booked a meeting room at the library for us to sit together and work together. An appointment in the library room took longer, which ranged from one to 4 hours a day. However, close to the deadline, the presentation part, we had to work together in a day in order to discuss and provide effective solutions as well as revise our work whether it meets our requirements or anything we did not consider so far.
